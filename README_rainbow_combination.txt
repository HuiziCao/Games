How to play the game (game rules) and/or how to run the simulation/visualization (simulation rules). 

Merging Rules and Scoring:
This is a combination game featuring balls of seven colors, representing the seven colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple, arranged in seven levels in this order. Three or four balls of the same color can be combined to form a ball of the next level. For example, three or four red balls can be combined into an orange ball, and three or four orange balls can be combined into a yellow ball. When there are three or four purple balls, they will disappear, and the player will receive 20 points.

Player's Control Range:
Players control the game by clicking on sticks. The first click causes the top ball on the clicked stick to rise and detach from the stick. A subsequent click on any stick (considered the second click) causes the detached ball to fall onto the stick that was clicked second. The ball that detaches is always the top ball on the stick clicked first. If the top two balls are of the same color, both will rise; if they are of different colors, only the top ball rises.

Other Game Mechanics Related to Player Operations:
Every time the player operates four times (meaning they have moved balls four times, which equates to clicking sticks eight times), the system will randomly drop balls from the top onto each stick. The level of the falling balls is random, but not higher than the current highest level present. Before dropping, the balls to be dropped are displayed for 5 seconds, during which time the player can continue to operate, and can see the color of the balls about to drop.

Game Over Rules:
Each stick can hold a maximum of seven balls. Attempting to place an eighth ball will cause all the balls to collapse, ending the game and displaying the final score.

I'm really sorry for not providing enough operational instructions, as I truly didn't have enough time. I'm truly sorry.
